# Template Artefacts
* Artefacts are formatted as HTML
** to allow the system to edit content, layout, and formatting as prompted
** for future proofing, artefacts are ready for online display, and incorporate **responsive design**
* Templates use {{variables}} to allow the system to input correct information in the correct place
* Templates ensure consistency in branding
* Templates allow me to **focus on the content**, and not waste time on aesthetics or formatting
