# Template Artefacts
- Artefacts are formatted as HTML to allow the system to edit content, layout, and formatting as prompted.
- Templates use {{variables}} to allow the system to input correct information in the correct place
- Templates ensure consistency in branding
- Templates allow me to *focus on the content*, and not waste time on aesthetics or formatting
